      <p>
        I am a high-energy, team-first and positive attitude person who thrives in fast-paced environments. Passionate about technology and innovation, I love to get my hands dirty and to find creative ways to get things done. <br><br>

        During my career in product management and trading, I have worked with cross-functional teams and have worn many hats, participating in all phases of the product life cycle, from design to launch. I believe my previous expertise combined with my curiosity and drive to find out-of-the-box solutions give me a strong foundation to pursue a career in the technology industry.
