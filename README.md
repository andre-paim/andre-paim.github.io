My webpage is published at http://andrepaim.me

I used different grid sizes to opmize for small devices, depending on the content. Sometimes I wanted the content to be stacked on small devices (used "col-md-") and sometimes I did not (used "col-sm-").

The editable javascript list can be found on the "Buy it now!" link on the navbar (buy.html).
