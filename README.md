My webpage is published at http://andrepaim.me

I used different grid sizes to opmize for small devices, depending on the content. Sometimes I wanted it to be stacked (used "col-md-") and sometimes I did not (used "col-sm-").

The editable javascript list can be found on the website, just go to the page Buy it now (buy.html)
